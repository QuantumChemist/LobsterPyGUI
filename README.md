# LobsterPyGUI
## A simple graphical user interface for LobsterPy 

I miss coding with C++ (compilable languages rule 🤘🏻) and I've never written a GUI, so I try to make one for LobsterPy for the people that are not familiar with the Linux terminal (yet). 
Sooooo 行きましょう!!!

Only suitable for Linux/GNU systems!

A very simple GUI to handle LOBSTER input and output with LobsterPy. The purpose of this GUI is to help beginners getting familiar with Linux and the cli. That's why the functionalities are kept very simple on purpose and it's only supposed to be used on a Linux/GNU based machine. Requires a GTK+ 3.0 lib.
